# 📚 Library Management System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Library Management System using SQL**. The goal of this project is to simulate real-world library database operations while strengthening concepts of **database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying**.

The system efficiently organizes and analyzes library data related to books, members, employees, and transactions, making it suitable as a **beginner-to-intermediate SQL portfolio project**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a **normalized relational database** for a library system
* Perform **CRUD operations** to reflect real-world workflows
* Apply **advanced SQL queries** for data analysis
* Generate **summary and analytical tables** for insights

---

## 🗂️ Database Schema

The project includes multiple interconnected tables, such as:

* **Books** – stores book details and availability
* **Members** – contains library member information
* **Employees** – manages staff-related data
* **Transactions** – tracks book issue and return records

The schema is designed following **normalization principles** to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## ⚙️ Key Features & SQL Concepts Used

* ✔️ Table creation with appropriate constraints
* ✔️ Insert, Update, Delete, and Select operations (CRUD)
* ✔️ **JOINs** to combine data from multiple tables
* ✔️ **GROUP BY & HAVING** clauses for aggregated analysis
* ✔️ **CTAS (Create Table As Select)** for building summary tables
* ✔️ Analytical queries to track:

  * Book issue frequency
  * Rental performance
  * Transaction trends

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases

* Identifying the most frequently issued books
* Analyzing member borrowing behavior
* Tracking employee-handled transactions
* Creating summary tables for reporting and insights

## 🧠 Learnings & Takeaways

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

* Writing efficient and readable SQL queries
* Structuring databases for real-world applications
* Thinking analytically while working with relational data
* Strengthening my foundation for **data analytics and reporting**

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the SQL file in your preferred SQL environment (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)
3. Run the scripts in sequence:

   * Schema creation
   * Data insertion
   * Query execution
4. Explore and modify queries for further analysis

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Add indexes for performance optimization
* Implement stored procedures and views
* Integrate the database with a frontend application
* Expand analytical queries for deeper insights
